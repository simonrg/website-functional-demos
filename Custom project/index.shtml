	<h1>Welcome to Hell Bent Gaming</h1>
	<p>Horror has been a popular genre in literature for hundreds of years, and in recent decades in films as well. By comparison video games have not received
	as much attention by the mainstream public.</p>
	
	<blockquote cite="http://www.aestheticsofplay.org/perron.php"><em>The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it demands from the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity 
	for detachment from everyday life. Relatively few are free enough from the spell of the daily routine to respond to tappings from outside, and tales of 
	ordinary feelings and events, or of common sentimental distortions of such feelings and events, will always take first place in the taste of the majority
	- Howard Philips Lovecraft (1927)</em></blockquote>
	
	<p>Hell Bent was created to recognise the niche genre of the growing (but still marginally disregarded) gaming industry and to inform visitors and help them
	gain a wider appreciation for horror in video games and the horror genre in general. Particularly this site is to celebrate the storytelling, art and diversity
	of what may otherwise appear to be an obscure sub-genre.</p>
