	<a name="re"></a><h2>Resident Evil</h2>
	<p>Perhaps out of all the horror titles today, none are as well known to gamers and the mainstream public as Capcom's <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise. Starting in 
	1996 on the original PlayStation, Resident Evil set the benchmark for survival horror games of the time with its dramatic art direction, sound design and 
	emphasis on survival. The series popularity spawned countless sequels, including two remakes and a movie series.</p>
	
	<img src="images/remake1.jpg" title="Remake of the original Resident Evil" alt="Image from the remake of the original Resident Evil"/>
	
	<p>When mutilated bodies start turning up in the rural Arklay Mountains, the special forces team <abbr title="Special Tactics and Reconaissance Squad">S.T.A.R.S.</abbr>
	is sent to investigate. Soon after arriving however, the squad is attacked and forced to take shelter in a mysterious mansion where they discover 
	a biochemical outbreak that has turned its inhabitants into zombies and mutant monsters </p>
	
	<p>The series popularity later led to several sequels; <em>Resident Evil 2</em> and <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em>, which both continued the story of the
	infection spreading outside the mansion and infecting the local populace, Raccoon City. These were followed by <em>Resident Evil Code: Veronica X</em> 
	on the <abbr title="PlayStation 2">PS2</abbr>. The series was redefined in 2005 by <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, widely considered as the beginning of Resident Evil's
	transition from a horror series into more of a third-person action-adventure. Regardless, RE4's introduction of the over-the-shoulder camera perspective
	would inevitably change how all third-person shooting games would be played forever in video-games.</p>

	<a name="sh"></a><h2>Silent Hill</h2>
	<p>The next big horror title came from Konami with the brooding, pyshcological horror thriller Silent Hill. The first Silent Hill released in 1999 
	has a dramatically different tone to Resident Evil. Instead of 'jump-scares' and throwing enemies at the player that are fast and dangerous, Silent Hill is
	a brooding, twisted and perverse horror adventure that relies less on combat and more on building tension through atmosphere.</p> 
	
	<p>Silent Hill is revered for its atmospheric tension, using fog and darkness to restrict the player's vision. This technique is supplemented by a pocket 
	radio the player carries that emits static when monsters are close. The combination of fog/darkness and the radio static commonly leads the player to being 
	conscious of noises around them before they are able to see anything.</p>
	
	<img src="images/sh2.png" title="Silent Hill 2: James standing amid the thick fog covering the town" alt="Image from Silent Hill 2"/>
	
	<p>Silent Hill is most regarded for its story. One of the most highly regarded entries in the series, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> follows the story of James Sunderland 
	who is searching for his dead wife after he receives a letter from her asking him to find her in Silent Hill. Cautious, but unable to resist the idea of 
	seeing her again, James' sadness and regret push him to search for her, but when he arrives he finds that Silent Hill is far from an ordinary mid-western town. 
	A thick fog covers the town, the streets are deserted, the roads out of town are blocked or destroyed, and he hears strange inhuman noises just beyond the shadows.</p>
	
	<p>Silent Hill's cult success leader to a number of titles in the series across different platforms, as well as a movie. Much like Resident Evil, Silent Hill's
	newer titles are generally not as highly regarded as the series' original four games.</p>
	
	<a name="other"></a><h2>Other Franchises</h2>
	
	<p>Certain titles (especially later titles in some series') are ommitted because they aren't considered horror. Additionally, games that are thematically
	'horror' like the <em>Castlevania</em> or <em>Diablo</em> series aren't included.</p>
