<div class="center-text">
<p>The W3C was an organisation that developed alongside the Web and through which the grounding principles of the organisation 
were established.</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>1980 - Tim Berners-Lee writes the 'ENQUIRE' system, a pre-cursor to the modern Web that introduces the concept of making links between arbitrary nodes. 
Although ENQUIRE uses hypertext, the system is very restrictive and limited by technical capabilities and expertise. 
Tim Berners-Lee wants to develop a system that is open for everyone.</li>
<li>1990 - Development of World Wide Web (WWW) begins. First Web client-server communication over the Internet later that year.</li>
<li>1993 - European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) releases Web protocol and code allowing anybody to use it royalty free.</li>
<li>1994 - World Wide Web Consortium is founded by Tim Berners-Lee, Al Vezza and Michael Dertouzous.</li>
<li>1997 - First HTML recommendation published by the W3C - HTML 3.2.</li>
<li>1998 - Guidelines for content internationalisation are adopted by W3C.</li>
</ul>
